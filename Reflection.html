    <h2>What I had learnt throughout this whole semester!</h2>   
<p>It was an enjoyable process as I learnt the "science" behind coding for circuit which was the most challenging part for me! I have never code in my entire life and had to ask the teachers for help on my coding for my final project! The teachers were nice enough and patient to teach me step by step which I'm grateful for. Ensuring the precise size for my laser cut and 3D print took me some time to figure out because accuracy is very important. I learnt how to use fusion360, tinkercad, cura and inkscape! All these will be useful for me if I want to be creative and use the resources available for me to design something that i can use in my daily life. I really do enjoy Digital Fabrication and made some good friends along the way. I didn't know i could get so creative and be so independent on completing a project even though i needed alot of help. I might consider changing schools to EEE because i think i love this more than CLS!! HEHE</p>
